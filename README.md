Application of swarm intelligence in boids
## Introduction
The Boids simulation is a computer model of coordinated motion developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. It simulates the flocking behavior of birds, schooling behavior of fish, and herding behavior of animals by representing them as individual agents, called "boids."

The word "boid" is derived from "bird-oid object," but it's a generic term used to represent any entity in the simulation, not just birds.

The key idea behind the Boids simulation is that complex group behavior can emerge from simple individual rules that each boid follows. These rules are based on three main principles:

1. Separation: Each boid tries to maintain a minimum distance from its neighbors to avoid collisions.
2. Alignment: Each boid tries to align its direction with that of its neighbors.
3. Cohesion: Each boid tries to move towards the center of mass of its neighbors.
